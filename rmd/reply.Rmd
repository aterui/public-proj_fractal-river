## Reply to the Editor

I ask the author to revise their manuscript according to the reviwers' comments.
Especially, as both reviewers pointed out, authors should explain the merit when this article would be published in Population Ecology rather than Communications Earth & Environment.

While I support this article's main argument, I have some concerns that need to be addressed. 
Firstly, the main arguments of Carraro and Altermatt (2022) are unclear from the present presentation of this article.
The author's concern would be worth considering if it is closely related to the main conclusions of Carraro and Altermatt (2022) and other publications citing it, but if this is a minor correction of terminology, the significance of this article may be lower than discussed in the manuscript.

L103: It may be fair to introduce "important insights" provided by Carraro and Altermatt (2022) so that readers can judge how critical their misunderstanding is.

Secondly, the author mentioned that this is a "widespread confusion" in the Abstract, so I wonder if the discussion of this article can be expanded to include similar arguments in other publications, even beyond the branching probability issue. 
Examples to be considered would include predator-prey interactions (Hatton et al., 2015), biological metabolism (Brown et al., 2004), food chain length (Sabo et al., 2010), and species-area relationship (Hubbell, 2001), as noted by the author (L99).

L36: It is not yet convincing whether this is really a "widespread confusion" among other studies. I want to see other examples.
L39: Cite references to provide other examples of misunderstanding about the definition of scale invariance. Hopefully, the author may discuss them in other section(s).

Lastly, I question whether this article should be published in Population Ecology or Communications Earth & Environment, the journal that published Carraro and Altermatt (2022). Although this decision is up to the editorial offices, I encourage the author to expand the discussion beyond the branching probability issue (as suggested in my comment #2) to increase the article's generality if it should be published in Population Ecology.

L63: I do not think this is a good analogy because mutualism is potentially antagonistic (i.e. the mutualism-antagonism continuum).
L71: "larger" => smaller?


L13: "the conclusion in Carraro and Altermatt (2022)" => their conclusion
L14: "their data and analysis" => reanalysis of their data
L14: "which is common" => in contrast to the common use
L30: You may cite references for "past research".
L31: What do you mean by "this observation"?
L33: "the original conclusion in Carraro and Altermatt (2022)" => their conclusion
L35: "their data and analysis" => reanalysis of their data
L58: "perfect" is not necessary as a square means a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four equal angles
L79: You may explain in more detail how equation 4 was derived.
L92: A_T is different between panels and captions (e.g. 12.7 km^2 and 1 km^2 for panel A).



## Reply to Reviewer 2

I found the draft interesting and well written. A major comment that I would like to add is that the abstract is written like a repetition of the introduction. It is better to revise the abstract.

Beside the technical part, I am wondering why the author has submitted the work to this journal? It is written like a discussion paper, following Carraro L, Altermatt F (2022) Communications Earth & Environment. I believe healthy academic discussions should be encouraged. If so, this work is more suitable to above journal?
