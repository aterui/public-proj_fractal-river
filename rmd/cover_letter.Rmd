Dear Editor;

I am submitting Matters Arising to express my concerns on the recent article by Carroro and Altermatt 2022 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00454-1>. In my understanding, their article contains serious flaws in their analysis and interpretation. It would be extremely important for this manuscript to be reviewed by experts in the field of scale-invariance.

Thank you for your careful consideration in advance.

Sincerely,

Akira Terui
