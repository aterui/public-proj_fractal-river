Dear Editor;

I am submitting a comment on a recent article by Carraro & Altermatt 2022 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00454-1). In this article, I would like to communicate my concern that the major conclusion in Carraro and Altermatt is simply a misconception of the term "scale invariance," which is common in the ecological literature.

I strongly suggest expert reviewers in the field of scale invariance or complex systems. I list a couple of suggested reviewers below.

- Dr. Andrea Rinaldo <andrea.rinaldo@epfl.ch> (fractal geometry in rivers)
- Dr. Scott Peckham <scott.peckham@colorado.edu> (fractal geometry in rivers)
-	Dr. Masato ABE <maabe@mail.doshisha.ac.jp> (complex systems)
- Dr. Hiromune Mitsuhashi <hiromune@hitohaku.jp>  (fractal geometry in rivers)
- Dr. Hideyuki Doi <hideyuki.doi@icloud.com> (fractal geometry in rivers)

Thank you for your careful consideration in advance.

Sincerely,

Akira Terui
